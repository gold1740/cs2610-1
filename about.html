		<p> Peter allen was born on earth in the year 25 <code>BDE</code>. He was a key asset to the federation during the Anartic War. He is mostly known for using cold fusion to create hot superconductors and integrating the technology into federation spacecraft. Despite his great acomplishments, Peter defected from the federation in the year 3 <code>BDE</code>, citing philisophical difference regarding neutrality in The Great War. Now he just writes a crappy blog in latin. </p>
